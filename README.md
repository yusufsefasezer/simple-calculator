# Simple Calculator
Simple JavaScript Calculator developed for sample purpose

The HTML5 and **JavaScript Simple Calculator** is a basic calculator that utilizes HTML5 markup language and JavaScript programming language to perform simple arithmetic calculations. It is a user-friendly tool designed to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.

The calculator is created using HTML5, the latest version of the Hypertext Markup Language. HTML5 provides a rich set of features and improvements that enhance the functionality and user experience of web applications. With HTML5, developers easily create interactive elements such as forms, multimedia, and animations. In the case of the Simple Calculator, HTML5 allows the creation of the user interface, including buttons for number input and operations, as well as displaying the result of calculations.

JavaScript, on the other hand, is the programming language used to bring the **Simple Calculator** to life. It is a versatile scripting language that enables dynamic interactions on web pages. JavaScript is responsible for performing the actual calculations based on the user's input and displaying the result in real-time. The code behind the calculator is written in JavaScript, instructing the browser on how to handle the calculations and update the display accordingly.

The JavaScript calculator code is the series of instructions written in the JavaScript programming language that defines the behavior and functionality of the calculator. It includes functions for performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as code for handling user interactions such as button clicks and input validation. This code essentially forms the logic behind the calculator, enabling it to perform calculations accurately and efficiently.

For those interested in exploring the inner workings of the Simple Calculator, the JavaScript calculator source code is available. This source code provides a more in-depth insight into how the calculator functions and serve as a valuable learning resource for budding web developers. By studying the source code, developers gain a better understanding of JavaScript programming concepts and apply them in their own projects.

There are numerous examples of JavaScript calculator code available online, showcasing different variations and approaches to creating a simple calculator using JavaScript. These examples serve as a starting point for developers looking to build their own calculators or modify existing ones. By studying and experimenting with these examples, developers improve their JavaScript skills and gain practical experience in creating interactive web applications.

The **JavaScript simple calculator source code** provides a stripped-down version of the calculator code, focusing on simplicity and readability. This code is perfect for beginners who want to understand the basics of creating a calculator using JavaScript. It provides a solid foundation for further customization and expansion, allowing developers to add new features or modify the existing ones according to their requirements.

To integrate the JavaScript simple calculator into an HTML document, the **JavaScript simple calculator HTML code** is used. This code includes the necessary HTML5 markup and JavaScript code to create the calculator's user interface and implement its functionality. By embedding the JavaScript code within the HTML markup, the calculator becomes a seamless part of the web page, ready to perform calculations as soon as the user interacts with it.

Overall, the HTML5 and **JavaScript Simple Calculator** is a powerful yet straightforward tool that demonstrates the capabilities of HTML5 and JavaScript. It showcases the integration of HTML5 elements and JavaScript code to create a functional and user-friendly calculator. Whether you are a beginner looking to learn JavaScript or an experienced developer seeking inspiration, exploring the JavaScript calculator code, source code, examples, and HTML implementation of this simple calculator provide valuable insights and help improve your skills in web development.
